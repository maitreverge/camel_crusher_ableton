# What does this project ?

Since a couple of time, the GUI of Camel Crusher is known for being broken on Ableton.

![Broken_image](https://github.com/maitreverge/camel_crusher_ableton/blob/1796df1fa5ed69f4ebfd8cbf2bf1e51cd2f1b1c7/read_me_pictures/pic_4.png)

The audio engine is still working underneath, so I mapped Camel Crusher's knobs to a custom audio rack :

![main_rack_pic](https://github.com/maitreverge/camel_crusher_ableton/blob/1796df1fa5ed69f4ebfd8cbf2bf1e51cd2f1b1c7/read_me_pictures/pic_2.png)

#### Here is what it looks like :

You will easily see that I mapped switches buttons to a traditional CV Ableton knob, from value 0 to 127 :
+ The Distorsion ON/OFF
+ The Filter ON/OFF
+ The Compressor ON/OFF
+ The Phat ON/OFF
+ The Master ON/OFF

Those 5 knobs behave like this :
+ From value 0 to 63 = The switch is **OFF**.
+ From value 64 to 127 = The switch is **ON**.


### **For convenience, consider the value 0 = OFF, and 127 = ON on switches knobs.**
